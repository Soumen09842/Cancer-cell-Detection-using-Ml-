    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <div class="technology">
      <div class="tech-card">
        <h3>Advanced ML Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Effective in molecular diagnostics and early cancer detection through feature selection in mass spectrometry data</li>
          <li>Decision Trees: Provide structured classification, often combined with ensemble methods to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting</li>
          <li>KNN: The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.</li>
          <li>Random Forests: Widely used for predictive modeling, such as estimating cancer risk and identifying molecular biomarkers</li>
        </ul>
